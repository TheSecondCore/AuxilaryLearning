# A dump of my javascript implementations of basic algorithms, data structures, design patterns, etc.
So after a while I finally decided to dump all my stuff on github. That is, the stuff I started learning in 2019. 
Anything prior to that I didn't save or lost over time. 
Feel free to take a look at it. :P
